                <strong>Description: </strong></br>This program is inspired by the google chrome logo. Utilizing triangular identites within a coordinate plane i created three different hexagons of different scale, where one contains the three outer chrome colors, the second is white to create a gap, and the last is blue. The outer hexagon is rotated about the origin and is interpolated to white throughout execution with an inward deformation as it fades to white. The inner two hexagons are stationary. As for the color choice, I decided to alter the typical chrome logo by having more variety of color between each triangular section. I believe it gives a cleaner look and complements the more geometric appearence created by having a hexagon shaped chrome logo rather than a circular one.

                <strong>Dynamically Mapping color from (r,g,b) to white.</strong></br>
                The rgb model is additive, to map the color to white I performed a linear interpolation between the current color and white, which essentially increased each respective r,g,b value. I used the mix function, where I interpolated the color with white. The one exception is I used a more 'extreme' version of white, where the rgb values exceeded the standard (1,1,1) to allow for a quicker and more dramatic interpolation. Additionally, the interpolation is scaled to increase as the image rotates. I monitored the change in theta, normalized this value to [0,1], and used this normalized variable to directly feed into the interpolation value between the color and white in the vertex shader.
